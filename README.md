# LPC-Toolkit
A toolkit of Max objects to use real-time linear predictive coding in creative projects

This project was initially developed in 2007 at Stanford's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), but it hasn't seen much attention since then. Contributions are welcome.


## Building

```
mkdir build
cd build
```

### Mac 

Run `cmake -G Xcode ..`

Next run `cmake --build .` or open the Xcode project from this "build" folder and use the GUI.

Note: you can add the `-j4` option where "4" is the number of cores to use.  This can help to speed up your builds, though sometimes the error output is interleaved in such a way as to make troubleshooting more difficult.

If you are running on a Mac M1 machine, you will likely see an error `cannot be loaded due to system security policy` when loading your externals in Max. To resolve this, you can ad-hoc codesign your external with `codesign --force --deep -s - myobject.mxo`.

### Windows

You can run `cmake --help` to get a list of the options available.  Assuming some version of Visual Studio 2019, the commands to generate the projects will look like this: 

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" ..`

Or using Visual Studio 2017 it will look like this:

`cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" ..`

Having generated the projects, you can now build by opening the .sln file in the build folder with the Visual Studio app (just double-click the .sln file) or you can build on the command line like this:

`cmake --build . --config Release`
